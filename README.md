# The statistical nature of *h*-index of a network node<br>

## Introduction<br>
MOS-index is an aggregation meothd of multiple order statistics, which is proposed in "The statistical nature of *h*-index of a network node".

## Usage<br>
Implementation of MOS-index depends on Python 3.6 and R 3.6.3.<br>

Import MOS.py file into Python and import RRA.r file into R, then load the dataset to test.
rra.csv is a .csv file without any information at initial state, which is used for storing the aggregation result, then the result can be loaded by MOS.py from rra.csv.
It would be better if three files (MOS.py, RRA.r, rra.csv) are downloaded in the same file.
